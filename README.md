### Hi, I'm Manda ðŸ‘‹

Theory:

I'm slowly moving my study notes across from a private Trello and adding new topics. If you would like to check them out they are available in the [study-note](https://github.com/nimisaya/study-notes) repo. They are unpolished but I'm happy for others to use them if they would like.
